# Rock_paper_scissor

In this program I will create a neural network to distinguish between a rock, a paper, and a scissor (hand gesture).

The data is available at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WXimLqASMJG76jvtrhuSYaggQd7dd14Q?usp=share_link .

To prepare the dataset I used ImageDataGenerator. The arguments for the ImageDataGenerator that I chose are rotation_range, brightness_range,
horizontal_flip, vertical_flip, shear_range. And then after that, the data will be put into the model.
